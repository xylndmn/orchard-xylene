    Mobile & Tablet Design (UI/UX Simplicity)
    
    For smaller screens, the layout is restructured into a single-column flow. 
    This ensures that the heading, supporting text, and imagery are stacked 
    vertically, giving each element full width and breathing space.

    Because:
    - Improves readability by avoiding cramped side-by-side layouts on narrow screens.
    - Reduces cognitive load: users can focus on one piece of content at a time.
    - Maintains visual hierarchy: headline → description → key highlight → images.
    - Ensures accessibility for users with smaller devices or varying screen densities.

    For the mobile and tablet layout, I kept the design simple and stacked the content vertically. 
    This way, the heading, text, and images flow in a clear order, making it easier to read without 
    the clutter of side-by-side layouts. The goal was to keep the experience clean, readable, and 
    straightforward so users can focus on the content comfortably on smaller screens. 
    
    I also chose the WebP format for images so they load faster while still keeping good quality — 
    helping the overall experience feel smooth and lightweight on mobile devices.
